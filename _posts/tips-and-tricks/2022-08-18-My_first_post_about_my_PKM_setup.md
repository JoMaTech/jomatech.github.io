## My first post about my PKM setup
A post to test that my setup works as it are supposed.

First what PKM is: ** PKM - Personal Knowledge Management**

![[../../assets/img/20220819-PKM_overview.png](/assets/img/20220819-PKM_overview.png)

My setup consist of:
- Obsidian - for creating of the posts in markdown.
- Visual Studio Code - for GitHub synchronization and config changes of Jekyll.
- GitHub and Jekyll with Chirpy theme settings to host the blog


### Overall configuration

#### GitHub repo locally
- Pull down of the Jekyll repo to a local disk folder
- Excluded some Obsidian files that I don't want to synch to the GitHub in .gitignore config file

> Templates
> .obsidian


#### Obsidian
- Open Obsidian from the synched git repo local folder. A new folder named .obsidian are created and include all configuration, plugins and settings.
- Created a template for the Jekyll defined header syntax. Added this to a Template folder.
- Goto Settings, change the Template settings. Choose the above folder.


#### Way forward
Will describe this setup in more detail later on when the setup are tested and more mature.
